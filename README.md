#Simple Clock

This app is a simple clock made in raylib which when compiled & run will run in borderless windowed mode and show a simple clock.

Clicking around will make ripples.

Quite rough around the edges, more polishing in the app and documentation itself coming soon.


#Requirements
raylib installation
g++ as a compiler
